      2 adds will spawn, and one of them will chain to you. this will give you a debuff that will kill you unless you take damage from the source of the chain. both adds will cast lariat combo and raise one arm. this will cause each add to cleave the width of the boss hitbox as well as the entire side of the arena in the direction of the raised arm. get hit by the add you were chained to here, or you will die shortly after. the adds will then execute the second hit of their lariat combo, both hitting the opposite side they hit first. this means the safe spot for the second cleave will always be opposite to the spot neither add hit on the first cleave.

      Everybody will get a fuse on their head, either short or long. all supports will get the same length, and all dps will get the opposite. at the same time, 8 bombs will spawn, 4 in the center and 1 in each corner. the sw and ne bombs are always long fuse, and the se and nw bombs are always short. the center bombs can be one of 2 patterns, either the 2 closest to sw or the 2 closest to ne will be long, and the remaining 2 will be short. when a bomb(or player) explodes, any players hit by the explosion will take some damage and receive a fire vuln for the duration of the mechanic, ensuring they can only be hit by one bomb total. the short fuse players and bombs will explode first, all at the same time, then a few seconds later, the long fuse players and bombs will explode all at the same time.

      Everyone will get a debuff, on a short or long timer. All supports will get one timer and all dps the other. If these debuffs expire, that player will die. The boss will ignite the center of the arena, making it deadly to step in, and 8 burning fuses will appear radiating from it, one on each intercard and cardinal. 4 of these will be short, and 4 long. Over time, these will get shorter, and if they reach the center, they will wipe the raid. Stepping on the burning ends will put out the fuse and cleanse your debuff, but will cause a heavy raidwide and a short magic vuln, ensuring you must space these cleanses out.

      All players will receive a short or long fuse, all dps receiving the same length and all supports receiving the other. The boss will start casting a conal aoe and will rotate and hit right next to it with another cone, and repeat this until the entire arena has been hit once. at the same time, 2 circles will appear, after these resolve they will expand and hit a large donut with the inner edge being where the edge of the circle was, then will expand again with a third donut. On the first donut a second set of circles will appear and do the same expanding motion. As the second set of circles resolve their first followup donut, the first set of player bombs will resolve. These will explode in a small aoe and give a fire vuln, ensuring you can only be hit by one. As the last set of donuts go off, the second set of player fuses will explode
