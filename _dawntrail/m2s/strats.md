# Beat 1
<details markdown=block><summary><font size="4" color="LightBlue">Everyone 2 Hearts</font>&nbsp;<font size="4" color="Crimson">H</font>&nbsp;<font color="Cyan">NASE</font></summary>
  Players with fewer than 2 hearts have priority on getting towers first, then all players with 2 hearts take the stack just south of the boss.
</details>
<details markdown=block><summary><font size="4" color="LightBlue">Melees get stack</font></summary>
  Take towers as normal, but leave a melee at one heart and other melees/tanks stop taking towers at 2 hearts, then only melees take the stack.
</details>
<details markdown=block><summary><font size="4" color="LightBlue">2 Player Stack</font></summary>
  This is really only viable in a static, as the people taking the stack can change depending on how the hearts are initially distributed. Take towers as normal, but ensure that your 2 chosen players only end up with 1 stack each. Have only these 2 players take the stack wherever is convenient for them.

# Alarm Pheromones 1
<details markdown=block><summary><font size="4" color="LightBlue">4 Center then YOLO</font>&nbsp;<font color="Cyan">NASE</font></summary>
  Bait the first 4 arrows center, then split off and run around and use your eyes to avoid the aoes.
</details>
<details markdown=block><summary><font size="4" color="LightBlue">Mario Kart from North</font>&nbsp;<font color="Yellow">Y</font></summary>
  Tank pulls boss north after Finale, then party stacks at north to bait first 4 arrows there. As soon as the 4th arrow is baited, run clockwise and do not stop unless you are about to run into an arrow about to go off. Ranged can split off towards the other side to bait less towards the melees.
</details>
<details markdown=block><summary><font size="4" color="LightBlue">Melees Stay Center</font></summary>
  Bait the first 4 arrows center, then melees go north(ish, use your eyes if theres an arrow there), and rotate around the boss hitbox to avoid the arrows. Ideally the boss does not move here. Ranged split south, then out towards the edge of the arena to dodge on their own.
