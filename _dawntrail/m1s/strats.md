# Quadruple Crossing
<details markdown=block><summary><font size="4" color="LightBlue">Clock Baits</font>&nbsp;<font size="4" color="Crimson">H</font></summary>
  This strat has everyone bait their cleaves on their clock spot, only moving in and out for the baits themselves, and dodging the non-baited aoes as they go off. DPS baiting first leaves the pair stacks on intercards, and the light party stacks on NW/SE. Support baiting first leaves partners on cardinals, and light parties on E/W

  This strat has both sets of baited aoes on the intercardinals, dps first, then supports taking their place after. stand on cardinals to dodge both sets of non-baited aoes. This will leave the pair stacks on cardinals, and the light party stacks on E/W

  Ranged position themselves on the outer 2 tiles and melee on the inner 2, and you can stay on your assigned non-cracked tile(still dodge the line aoes coming from other targeted players). if its a knockback, you can get knocked diagonally from one corner of your tile to the other. This is technically optional but you will be generally expected to be doing it.
</details>
<details markdown=block><summary><font size="4" color="LightBlue">Party Never Move</font></summary>
  Party positions on one of the 2 non-cracked tile in the center. Slams go out to the other side of the boss, and knockbacks get knocked from the other side onto the same row as the party. Can optionally have the knockback in the center get knocked diagonally from across the boss for true 0 party movement
